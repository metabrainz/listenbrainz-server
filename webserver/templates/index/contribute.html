  <h3>Last.fm users</h3>

  <p>
     We encourage Last.fm users to save their listen histories to ListenBrainz. While the project remains
     in an alpha stage, we cannot promise that the data will remain stable and intact. We may decide to wipe
     our database and to start over again. <strong>Until the project goes into beta, you should not have ListenBrainz
     be the only place where you keep your listen history!</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    To help us test this service, please import your listen history from Last.fm. To proceed, you will need a
    MusicBrainz account.

  <h3>Developers</h3>

  <p>
     ListenBrainz is in its infancy and we need a lot of help to implement more features and to debug the existing 
     features. If you feel like helping out and have experience with Python, Postgres, Kafka and/or Cassandra,
     we'd love some help.
  </p>

  <p>
     Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server">GitHub repository</a> for this 
     project to get started. You may also consider heading to our IRC channel #metabrainz on irc.freenode.net and
     asking people there what should be worked on next. Finally, we also have a bug tracker that keeps track of our
     <a href="http://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/LB">current issues</a>.
