        You have the following options for importing your listen data:
    </p>

    <h3> Import from ListenBrainz Alpha </h3>
      <p> The alpha version of the ListenBrainz site had one significant oversight: It imported listens from Last.fm using the Last.fm web page which only had <i>minute resolution</i> on the listen data. ListenBrainz really needs the more detailed <i>second resolution</i> data that is available from Last.fm API. To fix this problem and to preserve the data that some users may have submitted to ListenBrainz Alpha, please consider the two options carefully:
        <ol>
          <li>You have only used ListenBrainz to import data from Last.fm and have not submitted new listens to ListenBrainz directly. For this case, we recommend that you do a clean import of your Last.fm history from the Last.fm import below.
          <li>If you have submitted listens to ListenBrainz Alpha that are not in Last.fm, you can do an import from ListenBrainz Alpha into ListenBrainz Beta (the site you're using right now). Click the "Import Now!" button below to start this process. Please note that if you have both Last.fm imported data and your own submitted data, the Last.fm data that was previously imported will continue to have <i>minute resolution</i> timestamps.
        </ol>
      If you have questions about this, please feel free to <a href="https://metabrainz.org/contact">contact us</a>.

             You need to keep this page open for the tool to work, it might take a while to complete. Though, you can continue doing your work. :)

        <strong>Notes about the Last.fm import process:</strong>
     </p>
     <p>
        The Last.fm importer manually steps through your listen history and imports the listens
        one page at a time. Should it fail for whatever reason, it is safe to restart the import
        process. Running the import process multiple times <strong>does not</strong> create duplicates in your
        ListenBrainz listen history.
     </p>
     <br/>
     <p>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
     </p>
     We need to know your Last.fm username:
     <div class="well">
         <form action="" method="GET">
             <input type="text" name="lastfm_username" size="30" placeholder="Last.fm username">
             <input type="submit" value="proceed to step 2">
         </form>
     </div>
     {% endif %}

     <h3>Import a Last.fm backup file</h3>

     <p>Import your listens from a Last.fm backup file (.zip)</p>
     <div class="well">
         <form action="upload" method="POST" enctype=multipart/form-data>
             <input type="file" name="file">
             </br>
             <input type="submit" value="Upload">
         </form>
     </div>

     <h3>User token</h3>
     <p>
        If you would like to use an external program to import into ListenBrainz you will need the following
        user token:
     </p>

     <div class="well">
        {{ user.auth_token }}
     </div>
  {% endif %}
