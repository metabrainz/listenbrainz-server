    # We run eslint inside a docker container, the frontend sources are mounted
    # as a volume at /code/static. Therefore, the file name in the eslint output
    # has file paths beginning with /code/static. As a result, Github Actions is
    # unable to display those inline with code. To fix, this the output of eslint
    # is piped to sed which replaces /code/static with listenbrainz/webserver/static .
    # Finally, piping eats up the exit status so we exit manually with the correct status.
