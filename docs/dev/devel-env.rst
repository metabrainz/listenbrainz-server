Set up a development environment
================================

To contribute to the ListenBrainz project, you need a development environment.
With your development environment, you can test your changes before submitting a
patch back to the project. This guide helps you set up a development environment
and run ListenBrainz locally on your workstation. By the end of this guide, you
will haveâ€¦

* Install system dependencies
* Register a MusicBrainz application
* Initialize development databases
* Run ListenBrainz locally on your workstation


Install dependencies
--------------------

The ``listenbrainz-server`` is shipped in Docker containers. This helps create
your development environment and later deploy the application. Therefore, to
work on the project, you need to install Docker and use containers for building
the project. Containers save you from installing all of this on your own
workstation.

See the different installation instructions for your distribution below.

CentOS / RHEL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install epel-release
    sudo yum install docker docker-compose

Debian / Debian-based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose

Fedora
^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo dnf install docker docker-compose

openSUSE
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo zypper install docker docker-compose

Ubuntu / Ubuntu-based systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose


Register a MusicBrainz application
----------------------------------

Next, you need to register your application and get a OAuth token from
MusicBrainz. Using the OAuth token lets you sign into your development
environment with your MusicBrainz account. Then, you can import your plays from
somewhere else.

To register, visit the `MusicBrainz applications page`_. There, look for the
option to `register`_ your application. Fill out the form with these three
options.

- **Name**: (any name you want and will recognize, e.g. 
  ``listenbrainz-server-devel``)

- **Type**: ``Web Application``

- **Callback URL**: ``http://localhost/login/musicbrainz/post``

After entering this information, you'll have a OAuth client ID and OAuth client
secret. You'll use these for configuring ListenBrainz.


.. _MusicBrainz applications page: https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications
.. _register: https://musicbrainz.org/account/applications/register


Update config.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With your new client ID and secret, update the ListenBrainz configuration file.
If this is your first time configuring ListenBrainz, copy the sample to a live
configuration.

.. code-block:: bash

    cp listenbrainz/config.py.sample listenbrainz/config.py

Next, open the file with your favorite text editor and look for this section.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # MusicBrainz OAuth
    MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT_ID"
    MUSICBRAINZ_CLIENT_SECRET = "CLIENT_SECRET"

Update the strings with your client ID and secret. After doing this, your
ListenBrainz development environment is able to authenticate and log in from
your MusicBrainz login.

Also, in order for the Last.FM import to work, you should also update your
Last.FM API key in this file. Look for the following section in the file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Lastfm API
    LASTFM_API_URL = "https://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/"
    LASTFM_API_KEY = "USE_LASTFM_API_KEY"

Update the Last.FM API key with your key. After doing this, your
ListenBrainz development environment is able to import your listens from Last.FM.

In case you don't have a Last.FM API key, you can get it from `Last.FM API page`_.

You also need to update the ``API_URL`` field value to ``http://localhost``.

We also have a Spotify importer script which imports listens from
Spotify automatically using the Spotify API. In order to run this in your
local development environment, you'll have to register an application on the
`Spotify Developer Dashboard`_. Use ``http://localhost/profile/connect-spotify/callback``
as the callback URL.

After that, fill out the Spotify client ID and client secret in the following
section of the file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # SPOTIFY
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = ''
    SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = ''

.. note::

    The hostname on the callback URL must be the same as the host you use to
    access your development server. If you use something other than ``localhost``, you
    should update the ``SPOTIFY_CALLBACK_URL`` field accordingly.

.. _Last.FM API page: https://last.fm/api

.. _Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications


Initialize ListenBrainz containers
----------------------------------

Next, run the ``develop.sh`` script in the root of the repository. Using
``docker-compose``, it creates multiple Docker containers for the different
services and parts of the ListenBrainz server. This script starts Redis,
PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, and web server containers. This also makes it easy to stop
them all later.

The first time you run it, it downloads and creates the containers. But it's not
finished yet.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./develop.sh


Initialize ListenBrainz databases
---------------------------------

Your development environment needs some specific databases to work. Before
proceeding, run these three commands to initialize the databases.

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_db --create-db
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_msb_db --create-db
    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml -p listenbrainz run --rm web python3 manage.py init_influx

Your development environment is now ready. Now, let's actually see ListenBrainz
load locally!


Run the magic script
--------------------

Now that the databases are initialized, always start your development
environment by executing the ``develop.sh`` script. Now, it will work as
expected.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./develop.sh

You will see the containers eventually run again. Leave the script running to
see your development environment in the browser. Later, shut it down by pressing
CTRL^C. Once everything is running, visit your new site from your browser!

.. code-block:: none

   http://localhost

Now, you are all set to begin making changes and seeing them in real-time inside
of your development environment!


Test your changes with unit tests
---------------------------------

Unit tests are an important part of ListenBrainz. It helps make it easier for
developers to test changes and help prevent easily avoidable mistakes later on.
Before commiting new code or making a pull request, run the unit tests on your
code.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./test.sh

This builds and runs the containers needed for the tests. Each container does
not use volumes that link to data outside of the containers, so it does not
interfere with production databases.

There are some other options can be inputted to the parameter of the unit tests.

.. code-block:: bash
   ./test.sh -u # build and run the container, and load the database without running the tests.
   ./test.sh -s # stop all containers associated to the tests.
   ./test.sh -d # shutting down all containers associated to the tests.

Also, run the **integration tests** for ListenBrainz.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./integration-test.sh

When the tests complete, you will see if your changes are valid or not. These tests
are a helpful way to validate new changes without a lot of work.
