ListenBrainz documentation
==========================

ListenBrainz is a project by the MetaBrainz foundation which allows you to publicly store a record of all of the songs
that you listen to. Using this data, we provide statistics, recommendations, and a platform for you and other developers
to explore this data.

If you want to use the ListenBrainz API to read or submit data, see the :doc:`API documentation <users/api/index>`. You also
may want to review the JSON documentation.

If you are interested in contributing to ListenBrainz as a developer, see the
:doc:`Developer documentation. <developers/devel-env>`

We also publish some maintainer documentation, which is used by the MetaBrainz team to run the ListenBrainz site.
