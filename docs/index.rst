ListenBrainz' API documentation
===============================

This documentation is aimed at developers who want to :doc:`use our API <dev/api>` to submit and fetch listens. We suggest taking
a look the the :doc:`json <dev/json>` documentation, since most of the complexity in using the API comes from constructing/reading
the ListenBrainz JSON documents.
