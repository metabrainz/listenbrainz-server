Pull Requests Policy
====================

It is recommended that maintainers (unless the change is urgently needed) do not push directly or merge pull requests
without review . By default, **one** approving review is sufficient to merge a pull request. The pull request author
or the reviewer can request more reviews or review from a specific person as they deem necessary.
