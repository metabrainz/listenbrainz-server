# Full dump creation takes the ID of the last incremental
# dump and creates a full dump for that ID. So, we'll
# start creating full dumps and incremental dumps in pairs
# for now.

# Every Monday and Thursday
## incremental
10 00 * * 1,4 /code/listenbrainz/admin/create-dumps.sh incremental

## full -- a few hours after incremental for safety
10 02 * * 1,4 /code/listenbrainz/admin/create-dumps.sh full

## Around 24 hours later, trigger an import into the spark cluster
00 02 * * 2,5 /usr/local/bin/python /code/listenbrainz/manage.py spark request_import_full
