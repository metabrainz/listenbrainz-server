messybrainz-server
==================

The server components for the MessyBrainz project.

MessyBrainz is a [MetaBrainz](https://metabrainz.org) project to support unclean metadata. While
[MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org) is designed to link clean metadata to stable identifiers,
there is a need to identify unclean or misspelled data as well. MessyBrainz provides identifiers to
unclean metadata, and where possible, links it to stable MusicBrainz identifiers.

MessyBrainz is currently used in support of two projects, [ListenBrainz](https://listenbrainz.org)
and [AcousticBrainz](https://acousticbrainz.org). Submission to MessyBrainz is restricted, however
the resulting data will be made freely available.
