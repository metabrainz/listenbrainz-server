Steps to move MsB to TS database.

    1. Create the destination tables and index. The index only exists to avoid duplicates which may happen
       when the script is run multiple times.
    2. Run the script for first time.
    3. Stop TS writer.
    4. Rerun the script to insert submissions since first run.
    5. Switch MsB submission to new tables by updating TS writer.
    6. Profit!
