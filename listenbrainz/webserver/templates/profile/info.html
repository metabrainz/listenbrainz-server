    <p>
      If you think that a partial import has somehow missed some listens, you may reset your previous
      import timestamp. This will cause your next import to be a complete import which should add any
      missing listens while still avoiding adding duplicates to your history.
    </p>

    <p>If you want to reset your previous import timestamp, click below</p>
    <p>
      <span class="btn btn-info btn-lg" style="width: 300px"><a href="{{ url_for("profile.reset_latest_import_timestamp") }}" style="color: white;">Reset Import Timestamp</a></span>

    <h3>User token</h3>
    <p>
      If you would like to use an external program to submit data to ListenBrainz you will need the following
      user token:
    </p>

    <div class="well">
      {{ user.auth_token }}
    </div>

    <p>If you want to reset your token, click below</p>
    <p>
      <span class="btn btn-info btn-lg" style="width: 200px"><a href="{{ url_for("profile.reset_token") }}" style="color: white;">Reset token</a></span>

        You can make a request to get your statistics calculated. This will put you into a queue

        as soon as possible.
