{{user_name}}, your ListenBrainz Year in Music is now available.

The Year in Music report summarises your listening throughout the year of 2023. We have lots of soothing
statistics for you, like your most active listening day of the week, your listening activity over the year,
users who listened to similar music to you, and we‘ve generated up to 4 new playlists for you to keep enjoying
into 2024.

Top Discoveries, Tracks Released, and Top Recordings are all playlists that review your listening habits of
2023. We’ve also included one more playlist, Top Missed Recordings, which selects tracks that users similar to
you listened to, but you didn’t. Maybe there‘s still more for you to discover!

Thanks for being part of ListenBrainz.

Wishing you a restful 2024, from the ListenBrainz team.
