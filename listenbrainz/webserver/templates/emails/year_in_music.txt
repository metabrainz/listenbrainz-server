{{user_name}}, your ListenBrainz Year in Music 2022 is now available.

We have compiled your personal Year in Music report for 2022 ( https://listenbrainz.org/user/{{user_name}}/year-in-music/ ), which summarises your listening habits throughout the year. Some of the statistics you can expect to see include your most active listening day of the week, your listening days throughout the year, and users who listened to similar music to you.
To top it off, we've made a map of where your artists are from and we have also generated two new playlists for you to discover even more music in 2023.
We hope you enjoy the report and the new playlists!

Happy listening, and thanks for being part of ListenBrainz!
Wishing you a wonderful 2023, from the ListenBrainz team.
