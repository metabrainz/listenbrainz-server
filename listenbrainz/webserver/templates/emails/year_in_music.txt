{{user_name}}, your ListenBrainz Year in Music is now available.

The Year in Music report summarises your listening throughout the year of {{year}}. Check out your
highlights, statistics, most active days of the week, and more! 

New this year: you can now navigate through the years and go on a trip down memory lane.
You get the same stats and playlists for every year you have data for in ListenBrainz,
available at any time for when you're feeling nostalgic.

Meanwhile, jam along with the new playlists that we've generated for you based on your listens.
See what you discovered throughout the year and what gems you missed out on based on users with similar tastes.

Don't forget you can share images of your stats, with the #yearinmusic hashtag.
We will be re-posting the hashtag on our channels (links are at the bottom of the email),
come check out what music everyone's been listening to in the past year.

Thanks for being part of this community.

Wishing you a restful {{year + 1}}, from the ListenBrainz team.
