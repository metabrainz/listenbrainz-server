{{user_name}}, your ListenBrainz Year in Music is now available.

The Year in Music report summarises your listening throughout the year of 2024. Check out your
highlights, statistics, most active days of the week, and more! This year they are presented by
some leafy little friends - check out all four seasons and find your favourites. Meanwhile, jam
along with the new playlists that we've generated for you based on your listens. See what your
followed users got up to. And hunt for gems from other users that had similar tastes throughout
the year.

We have made some adjustments to how we handle genres this year, and calculated you a flash new
genre graph that provides a much more detailed genre breakdown. The rainbow cover art mosaic from
previous years has been replaced with album cover mosaics from the most popular releases.

Don't forget to share your stats in your favourite seasonal theme, with the #yearinmusic
hashtag. We will be re-posting the hashtag on our channels (bluesky and mastodon links are at the
bottom of the email), come see what music has been making everyone's leaves rustle with excitement
in the past year.

Thanks for being part of ListenBrainz.

Wishing you a restful 2025, from the ListenBrainz team.
