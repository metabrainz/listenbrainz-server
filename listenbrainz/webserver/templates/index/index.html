      <h2 class="page-title">Welcome to ListenBrainz!</h2>
          <p>
            The ListenBrainz project is similar to the original AudioScrobbler&reg;. Unlike
            the original project, ListenBrainz is open source and will publish its data as
            open data.
          </p>
          <p>
            A team of former Last.fm and current <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>
            hackers created the first version of ListenBrainz in the space of a weekend. Since
            the original project was created, technology has advanced at an incredibly
            rapid pace, which made re-creating the original project fairly straightforward.
          <p>
          <p>
            The project has two main goals:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Allow users to preserve their existing Last.fm&reg; data. ListenBrainz is
                operated by the <a href="https://metabrainz.org">MetaBrainz Foundation</a> which
                has a long-standing history of curating, protecting and making data
                available to the public. MetaBrainz commits itself to safe-guarding the
                ListenBrainz data indefinitely.
            </li>
            <li>Make this incredibly useful music usage data available to anyone who cares to
                play with it. We hope that the combination of ListenBrainz, MusicBrainz and
                <a href="http://acousticbrainz.org">AcousticBrainz</a> will provide enough
                data for developers to create new music recommendation systems. Music recommendation
                systems are hard to develop because comprehensive music data sets do not
                exist in the open. Normally start-ups spend vast amounts of money to create
                these data sets before building recommendation systems. We aim to short-cut
                this process and put the power to create recommendation engines into the hands
                of everyone. We plan to release the data under the
                <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 License</a>.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          For more information about this project and its goals, please take a look at our
          <a href="{{ url_for('index.goals') }}">goals page</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          At this point the project is in its infancy -- we have lots of things that will
          need to be built and improved before this project will be useful to the general
          public. If you are a hacker and interested in helping out, please have a look
          at the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server">code repository</a>
