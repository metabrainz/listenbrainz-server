        Visualize and share your music listening history
      </h2>
      <p>
        ListenBrainz keeps tracks of what music you listen to and
        provides you with insights into your listening habits.
        <br>
        We're completely open-source and publish our data as open data.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use ListenBrainz to track your music listening habits and
        share your taste with others using our visualizations.
        <br>
        We also have an
        <a href="https://listenbrainz.readthedocs.io/en/production/dev/api/">API</a>
        if you want to do more with our data.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, you'll need to <a href="{{ url_for('login.index') }}">sign in</a> with
        a <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> account. If you don't have a MusicBrainz
        account, you can <a href="https://musicbrainz.org/register">create one</a>!
        <br>
        Once you have an
        account, you can <a href="{{ url_for('profile.import_data') }}">import</a>
        data from Last.FM, <a href="{{ url_for('profile.music_services_details') }}">connect your Spotify account</a>,
        or use one of the <a href="{{ url_for('index.add_data_info') }}">many players</a> which can
        automatically record your listening history.

      <h2>Discover new music</h2>
      <p>
        Based on your listening history we recommend music you might like, new music you missed out on
        from your favorite artists, as well as what similar users have been listening to.
        <br>
        There are many ways to explore and discover new music with ListenBrainz!

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>The ListenBrainz project has a number of goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A public store of your listen history. We feel that a listen history has a tremendous
        amount of personal value and in aggregate has a huge amount of value for developers who wish
        to create better music technologies, like recommendation systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        A permanent store of your listen history. MetaBrainz, the non-profit that runs
        <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> and ListenBrainz has a long
        history of curating and making data available to the public in a useful and meaningful manner. We promise
        to safeguard your listen history permanently.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make data dumps of this listen history available for download. We want everyone who is interested
        in this data to have access to the data and to use it in any manner they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        To share listen histories in a distributed fashion. We plan to allow anyone to connect to ListenBrainz
        and to tap into a live feed of listen data as we receive it. We hope that Last.fm will work with us
        to make an interconnection with Last.fm possible. We welcome anyone scrobbling to us and we plan to share the listens
        shared with us to anyone else who wants them. We envision smaller music communities with a specific focus
        to install their own ListenBrainz server to collect listen data for their specific focus. We hope that
        these smaller communities will also share their data in the same manner in which we share our data.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Anti-goals</h3>

    <p>The project also has a number of anti-goals (things it doesn't try to be):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        A store for people's private listen history. The point of this project is to build a public, shareable
        store of listen data. As we build out our sharing features, building a private listen store will become
        possible, but that is not part of our goals.
      </li>
      <li>
        A closed platform. We aim to make everything open and to encourage a community of sharing and participation.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="page-title">Roadmap</h2>

    We've put together a very rough roadmap for this project:

    <h3>Short term</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Work to improve and extend the user data graphing features.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Medium term</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Start working on an open source recommendation engine using data from ListenBrainz,
        <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org">AcousticBrainz</a> and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Incremental data export: To export smaller data deltas on a more frequent basis than our full data dumps.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long term</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Total world domination. What other goals are open source projects allowed to have?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br/>

    <p>
      If you have any ideas that should be on our roadmap, please <a href="https://metabrainz.org/contact">let us know</a>!

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> Why do you call your data Listens?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> The term <strong>scrobble</strong> is a trademarked term
      by Last.fm and we cannot use it. Instead we use the term <strong>listen</strong>.
    </p>
      <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> Is it safe for the Last.fm importer to be run twice?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Yes, it is. Running it twice will not cause duplicates in your listen history.
    </p>
      <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> I can't play music on the pages; what's going on?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Make sure your browser is allowing autoplaying media on listenbrainz.org.
      <br/>If you have a Spotify account, you'll have much better results if you <a href="{{ url_for('profile.music_services_details') }}">connect it to ListenBrainz</a>. Otherwise you'll be limited to 30 second excerpts.
    </p>
      <br/>
    <p>
      <strong>Q:</strong> I connected my Spotify account but the player just doesn't work<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> Before anything else, try disconnecting and <a href="{{ url_for('profile.music_services_details') }}">reconnecting your Spotify account</a>
      <br/>
        Make sure you select the permissions to 'record listens and play music' or 'play music only'.

      <br/><br/>
        Still no luck? You might have stumbled onto a bug! We would be grateful if you could <a href="https://tickets.metabrainz.org/projects/LB">report it here</a> along with the content of your browser's console.
