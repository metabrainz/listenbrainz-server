<h2 class="page-title">Goals</h2>

<p>The ListenBrainz project has a number of goals:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>A public store of your listen history.</b> We feel that a listen history has a tremendous
        amount of personal value and in aggregate has a huge amount of value for developers who wish
        to create better music technologies, like recommendation systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A permanent store of your listen history.</b> MetaBrainz, the non-profit that runs
        <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a> and ListenBrainz has a long
        history of curating and making data available to the public in a useful and meaningful manner. We promise
        to safeguard your listen history permanently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>To make data dumps of this listen history available for download.</b> We want everyone who is interested
        in this data to have access to the data and to use it in any manner they wish.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>To share listen histories in a distributed fashion.</b> We plan to allow anyone to connect to ListenBrainz
        and to tap into a live feed of listen data as we receive it. We hope that Last.fm will work with us
        to make an interconnection with Last.fm possible. We welcome anyone scrobbling to us and we plan to share the listens
        shared with us to anyone else who wants them. We envision smaller music communities with a specific focus
        to install their own ListenBrainz server to collect listen data for their specific focus. We hope that
        these smaller communities will also share their data in the same manner in which we share our data.
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Anti-goals</h3>

<p>The project also has a number of anti-goals (things it doesn't try to be):</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <b>A store for people's private listen history.</b> The point of this project is to build a public, shareable
        store of listen data. As we build out our sharing features, building a private listen store will become
        possible, but that is not part of our goals.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A closed platform.</b> We aim to make everything open and to encourage a community of sharing and participation.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 class="page-title">Roadmap</h2>

We've put together a very rough roadmap for this project:

<h3>Short term</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Work to improve and extend the user data graphing features.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Medium term</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        Start working on an open source recommendation engine using data from ListenBrainz,
        <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org">AcousticBrainz</a> and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Incremental data export: To export smaller data deltas on a more frequent basis than our full data dumps.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Long term</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Total world domination. What other goals are open source projects allowed to have?
    </li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>
    We also have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/kNrJb7Jq/listenbrainz-planning">Trello</a> board to keep track of
    our short-term tasks and deadlines. Feel free to take a look!
</p>

<p>
    If you have any ideas that should be on our roadmap, please <a href="https://metabrainz.org/contact">let us know</a>!

<h2 class="page-title">Contributing to ListenBrainz</h2>

<h3>Donating</h3>
<p>
    Listenbrainz is a free open source project that is not run for profit. If you would like to help the project out
    financially, consider <a href="https://metabrainz.org/donate">donating</a> to the MetaBrainz Foundation.
</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>
<p>
    ListenBrainz is in its infancy and we need a lot of help to implement more features and to debug the existing
    features. If you feel like helping out and have experience with Python, Postgres and Redis,
    we'd love some help.
</p>
<p>
    Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server">GitHub repository</a> for this
    project to get started. You may also consider heading to our IRC channel #metabrainz on irc.libera.chat and
    asking people there what should be worked on next. Finally, we also have a bug tracker that keeps track of our
    <a href="http://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/LB">current issues</a>.
