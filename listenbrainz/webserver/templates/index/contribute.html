  <h3>Last.fm users</h3>

  <p>
     We encourage Last.fm users to save their listen histories to ListenBrainz.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help us test this service, please import your listen history from Last.fm. To proceed, you will need a
    MusicBrainz account.

  <h3>Developers</h3>

  <p>
     ListenBrainz is in its infancy and we need a lot of help to implement more features and to debug the existing
     features. If you feel like helping out and have experience with Python, Postgres and Redis,
     we'd love some help.
  </p>

  <p>
     Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server">GitHub repository</a> for this
     project to get started. You may also consider heading to our IRC channel #metabrainz on irc.freenode.net and
     asking people there what should be worked on next. Finally, we also have a bug tracker that keeps track of our
     <a href="http://tickets.musicbrainz.org/browse/LB">current issues</a>.
