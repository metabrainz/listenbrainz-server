  <h2 class="page-title">Roadmap</h2>

  We've put together a very rough roadmap for this project:

  <h3>Short term</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
       Work to improve and extend the user data graphing features.
    </li>
    <li>
       Improve the use of Google's BigQuery database. Right now our data tables are too simplistic for serious data processing.
       We will need to investigate our future query needs and then reorganize the data accordingly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Medium term</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
       Start working on an open source recommenation engine using data from ListenBrainz, 
       <a href="https://acousticbrainz.org">AcousticBrainz</a> and <a href="https://musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Incremental data export: To export smaller data deltas on a more frequent basis than our full data dumps.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Long term</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Total world domination. What other goals are open source projects allowed to have?
    </li>
  </ul>

    We also have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/kNrJb7Jq/listenbrainz-planning">Trello</a> board to keep track of
    our short-term tasks and deadlines. Feel free to take a look!
