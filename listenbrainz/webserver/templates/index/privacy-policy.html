  <h2 class="page-title">ListenBrainz Privacy Policy</h2>

  <h3>Important note</h3>

  <p>
    This privacy policy only addresses situations specific to ListenBrainz that are not covered
    by the MetaBrainz organization wide privacy policy. <b>We strongly urge you to read the
    full <a href="https://metabrainz.org/privacy">MetaBrainz privacy policy</a> before you
    read the remainder of this ListenBrainz specific privacy policy.</b>
  </p>

  <h3>Use of your YouTube profile information</h3>

  <p>
    The embedded music player that is present in a number of pages on ListenBrainz can
    <a href="{{ url_for('profile.music_services_details') }}">optionally be connected to
    play YouTube content</a>. During the connection process ListenBrainz will request
    permissions to view your YouTube profile data. Unfortunately this is the minimum
    permission level offered by YouTube and thus if we wish to offer the ability to search for YouTube
    content on ListenBrainz pages, we are required to ask for this permission, even though we do
    not need or want access to your YouTube profile. Your data is used only to
    authenticate to your YouTube account and for no other purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    ListenBrainz does not actually look at your YouTube profile. <b>We do not inspect, download
    or in any way save any data that is available in your YouTube profile. None, at all.</b>
  </p>

  <h4>Have a look for yourself</h4>

  <p> 
    If you wish to inspect our source code that is running on our servers, please take a look
    at our 
    <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/master/listenbrainz/domain/youtube.py">
    implementation of how we interact with your YouTube profile</a>. Furthermore, in <a
    href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/master/listenbrainz/webserver/static/js/src/utils.tsx">
    utils.tsx</a> you can inspect the function <em>searchForYoutubeTrack</em> which shows
    the single YouTube API function that ListenBrainz uses.
  </p>

  <h3>MetaBrainz Privacy Policy</h3>

  <p>
    The entirety of the <a href="https://metabrainz.org/privacy">MetaBrainz privacy policy</a> also
    applies to ListenBrainz, not only the portions covered here. We urge you to read this policy
    in full!
