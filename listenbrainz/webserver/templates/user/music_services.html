                <h3>A note about permissions</h3>

                <p>
                    In order to enable the feature to record your listens you will need to grant the permission to view
                    your recent listens and your current listen.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to play tracks on the ListenBrainz pages you will need to grant the permission to play
                    streams from your account and create playlists. Oddly enough, Spotify also requires the permission
                    to read your email address, your private information and your birthdate in order to play tracks.
                    These permissions are required to determine if you are a premium user and can play full length
                    tracks or will be limited to 30 second previews. However, <b>ListenBrainz will never read these
                    pieces of data</b>. We promise! Please feel free to
                    <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/master/listenbrainz/spotify_updater/spotify_read_listens.py">
                        inspect our source</a> code yourself!
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can revoke these permissions whenever you want by unlinking your Spotify account.

                    ListenBrainz integrates with Youtube to let you play music tracks from ListenBrainz pages.
                    You do not need to do anything to enable this. ListenBrainz will automatically search for
                    tracks on Youtube and play one if it finds a match.
