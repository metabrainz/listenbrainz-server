                    ListenBrainz integrates with Youtube to let you play music tracks from ListenBrainz pages.
                    ListenBrainz has a number of music discovery features that require authentication to search
                    and play tracks from Youtube.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can revoke these permissions whenever you want by unlinking your Youtube account.

    <h3>A note about permissions</h3>

    <p>
        In order to enable the feature to record your listens you will need to grant the permission to view your
        recent listens and your current listen.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to play tracks on the ListenBrainz pages you will need to grant the permission to play streams from
        your account and create playlists.
        Oddly enough, Spotify also requires the permission to read your email address, your private information and
        your birthdate
        in order to play tracks. These permissions are required to determine if you are a premium user and can play
        full
        length tracks or will be limited to 30 second previews. However, <b>ListenBrainz will never read these
        pieces of data</b>.
        We promise! Please feel free to
        <a href="https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-server/blob/master/listenbrainz/spotify_updater/spotify_read_listens.py">inspect
            our source</a> code yourself!
    </p>

    <p>
        You can revoke these permissions whenever you want by unlinking your Spotify account.
    </p>
