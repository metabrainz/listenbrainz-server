    <p>
        Most users will want to import from Last.fm directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Direct import from Last.fm</h3>
      <p>
        The Last.fm importer manually steps through your listen history and imports the listens
        one page at a time. Should it fail for whatever reason, it is safe to restart the import
        process. Running the import process multiple times <strong>does not</strong> create duplicates in your
        ListenBrainz listen history.
      </p>
      <p>In order for this to work, you must disable the &#34;Hide recent listening information&#34;
        setting in your Last.fm <a href="https://www.last.fm/settings/privacy">Privacy Settings</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clicking the "Import now!" button will import your profile now without the need to open lastfm.<br/>
        You need to keep this page open for the tool to work, it might take a while to complete. Though, you can continue doing your work. :)
      </p>
      We need to know your Last.fm username:
      <div class="well">
        <div id="react-container">
        </div>
      </div>
