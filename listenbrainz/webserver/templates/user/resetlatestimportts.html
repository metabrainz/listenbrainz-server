  <h3 class="page-title">Reset Import Timestamp</h3>
  <p>Are you sure you want to reset your import timestamp? </p>

  <p>
     Our last.fm importer keeps track of the listens you've imported and then only imports
     new listens added after previous imports. To do this, we keep track of the timestamp of
     the newest listen submitted in your last.fm import. By resetting this timestamp, you'll
     be able to import your entire last.fm data again. However, this will not create duplicates in
     your ListenBrainz listen history.
