            The recommended tracks are generated by processing user listening history which the user might like. The tracks fall into two categories:

            <ul><li><b>Top Artist: </b>The top artist tracks are generated by fetching and processing tracks belonging to top artists listened to by the user in the last week of generation of recommended tracks.</li></ul>

            <ul><li><b>Similar Artist: </b>The similar artist tracks are generated by fetching and processing tracks belonging to artists similar to top artists listened to by the user in the last week of generation of recommended tracks.</li></ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The tracks are sorted on the score. Higher the score, more likely it is for the user to like that track. The score associated with a track lies in between 0 and 1.
