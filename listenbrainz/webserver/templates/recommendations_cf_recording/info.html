            The recordings shown in the next tab have been generated by a collaborative filtering algorithm
            using your past listening history. This page is mostly intended to be a debugging page, which is
            why it isn't linked from our pages. At the moment we have the following recommended tracks available:

            <ul><li><b>Raw recommendations: </b>These recordings are selected because they are unfiltered and
                       similar to your listened recordings.
            </li></ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        The sets of recordings above are sorted on the score that was assigned by the collaborative filtering
        algorithm; a higher score indicates a greater likeliness that you would like this selected track, at
        least in theory. For more information about this work and how to give us feedback on these recordings,
