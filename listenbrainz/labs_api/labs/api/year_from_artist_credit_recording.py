        Lookup year from artist_credit_name and recording name. The main goal of this lookup

        metadata hasn't been looked up in MB and it doesn't exactly match what is in MB,
        then this query will return no results. If a year lookup with more flexiblity is needed
        in the future, then another endpoint will need to be created. This version is catering
        to the needs of troi.
