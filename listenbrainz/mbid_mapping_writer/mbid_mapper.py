    """
        This class performs a lookup of one or more artist credit name and recording name pairs
        to find the best possible match in MusicBrainz. This query will unaccent query
        parameters, be resistant to typos and attempt to modify the search parameters
        in effort to find a best match.

        For instance, if "Glory Box feat. Sloppy Jo" isn't matched, it will try to match "Glory Box".
        It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the results meet the criteria for the
        given task. This mapping lookup aims to find a match by a number of means necessary that
        may or may not be acceptable to the caller.

        Other possible detunings:
        - Swap artist/recording
        - remove track numbers from recording

        Overall these detunings and edit distances will need more tuning as we start using this
        endpoint for our MessyBrainz mapping. For this reason the debug flag and optional
        debug output remains since more debugging/tuning will need to be done later on.
