MessyBrainz MSID to MusicBrainz ID mapping
==========================================

This mapping maps the data in MessyBrainz ( https://messybrainz.org ) to MusicBrainz data.

The mapping comes in three flavors, with differing levels of details:

* Minimal: With only the needed MSB (Messybrainz) IDs and MBIDs
* Full: MSB (Messybrainz) IDs and MBIDs and the MSB text strings.
* Matchable: MSB (Messybrainz) IDs and MBIDs and the MSB text strings and MSB matchable strings (see below for details).

Matchable strings are the full strings, but they have been converted to lower case, diacritics have been removed (e.g ü -> u),
and non-word characters have been removed:

    'Röntgen X-Rays' ==> 'rontgenxrays'

Removing extra stop-characters from the mapping increases the chances of finding correct matches.

fields prefixed with msb_ are MessyBrainz fields and fields prexfixed with mb_ are their MusicBrainz counterparts.

Usage
-----

To use this index data to match music tracks to MusicBrainz IDs, you can do the following.

1. Convert your recording name and artists name from your music track to be a matchable string.
2. Search the mapping to see if that recording name and artist name pair contain an entry.
3. If an entry is found, the best matching recording MBID will be in the mb_recording_mbid field.


Algorithm
---------

The mapping is created by selecting all of the single artist releases in MusicBrainz and ordering them
so that most recent digital releases are preferred. The recording name and artist names (artist credit names, really)
for these releases are then matched against the data in MessyBrainz to create this mapping.
