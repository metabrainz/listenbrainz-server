## About

The ListenBrainz project is similar to the original AudioScrobbler®. Unlike the
original project, ListenBrainz is open source and publishes its data as open
data.

A team of former Last.fm and current MusicBrainz hackers created the first
version of ListenBrainz in a weekend. Since the original project was created,
technology has advanced at an incredibly rapid pace, which made re-creating the
original project fairly straightforward.

The project has two main goals:

1. Allow users to preserve their existing Last.fm® data
2. Make this incredibly useful music usage data available to the world

For more information about this project and its goals, look at our
[website](https://listenbrainz.org/), specifically the
[goals page](https://listenbrainz.org/goals).
